- ✅ Basic problems (loops, conditionals, operators)
- ✅ Pattern printing
- ✅ Array and string manipulations
- ✅ Functions and recursion
- ✅ Sorting and searching algorithms
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises
- ✅ DSA problems in Java (coming soon...)

🧠 Why This Repo?

This repo is part of my daily problem-solving practice and interview preparation. It also helps track my progress while learning Java + DSA from scratch.
